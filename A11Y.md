# Accessibility Documentation

This document outlines the accessibility features and improvements implemented in the project to ensure an inclusive experience for all users, including those with disabilities. Below are the key points that have been considered to make this application accessible:


## 1. Keyboard Accessibility

All interactive elements, including buttons and modals, are **keyboard accessible**. Users can navigate and activate these elements using the keyboard (e.g., pressing "Enter" , "Tab" or "Space" to activate buttons).

## 2. Modal Accessibility

The modals (e.g., **Create Game**, **Join Game**, **Delete Game**, **Session Started**) have been implemented to ensure proper focus management:
- **Focus** is automatically managed when a modal is shown, and focus is returned to the last active element when the modal is closed.
- **Keyboard Navigation** is fully supported within modals to ensure users can navigate between form fields, buttons, and other elements without using a mouse.

## 3. Button Accessibility

Buttons throughout the application have been made accessible through:
- **Focus management**: Buttons are styled and structured to ensure they can be navigated to via the keyboard and have clear visual feedback on focus.


## 4. Form Element Accessibility

All form inputs, including those in modals (e.g., **Enter Game Name**, **Upload Game File**, **Enter Session ID**), have been made accessible by:
- Associating **`<label>` elements** with input fields to ensure screen readers can identify the purpose of each field.

## 5. Color Contrast

The application supports a **light and dark mode** toggle, ensuring that text and background color contrast meets the **standards**. The dark mode background and text color combinations have been chosen to ensure sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments.
