### Implemented Dark Mode 
We implemented dark mode to improve the user experience and accessibility of the app, especially in low-light environments.

Why?
-To make the UI easier on the eyes during nighttime or long usage sessions.

-To give users control over how they view the app.

-To align with modern design standards that support dark themes.

How It Works
-You can manually toggle between light and dark modes using the theme switcher.
-Your choice is saved, so it stays consistent across sessions.
